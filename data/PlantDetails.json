There is differing information about the number of existing ficus species there may be between 800 and 2000. They live on all continents in the tropical regions and are very suitable for being kept as indoor Bonsai. Some figs can become very large trees with a crown circumference of more than 300 m (1000 ft). Typical for all fig Bonsai species is their milky latex sap which will leak from wounds or cuts. The tropical figs are evergreen trees small shrubs or even climbing plants. The Ficus Ginseng has a thick pot-bellied trunk similar to the Ginseng root.",

      "Water": "Water the Chinese banyan as soon as the soil becomes dry on one centimeter, water so as to moisten all of it. During a growth period (spring, summer), watering should be regular - once or twice a week - but measured in order not to asphyxiate the roots of plants. In a fall, space the waterings gently, until winter.",
      "Pruning": "Use sharp pruning shears to remove the sucker branches and the errant branches that are growing in the wrong direction or making it difficult to fertilize the tree. Since Chinese banyan has a conical habit, trim the tree as per its natural shape. Trimming should be done every week during the summer.",

      "Fertilizer": "Many ornamental grasses are selections of native prairie or woodland plants. In their natural habitat, the only nutrients they receive comes from their own decomposing foliage and that of the plants around them. You can mimic those conditions by mulching around the base of your grasses in fall with shredded leaves.

The soil's top inch (2.5 cm) should feel dry before you water the plant again. Never let the soil dry out completely. It’s best to use filtered or distilled water because chemicals in tap water can damage your plant. Calathea also needs high humidity, resembling rainforest conditions. You can use a plant humidifier or put your plant on a tray with pebbles covered in water in half. In the latter case, don’t let the water touch the bottom of the pot. Misting is also good but not as effective.",

It is native in a range from China through tropical Asia and the Caroline Islands to Australia. It’s a popular indoor tree species for Bonsai beginners. The ficus genus belongs to the family of mulberry plants (Moraceae) and is the most popular indoor tree species for beginners at Bonsai. There is differing information about the number of existing ficus species, there may be between 800 and 2000. They live on all continents in the tropical regions and are very suitable for being kept as indoor Bonsai. Some figs can become very large trees with a crown circumference of more than 300 m (1000 ft). Typical for all fig Bonsai species is their milky latex sap, which will leak from wounds or cuts. The tropical figs are evergreen trees, small shrubs or even climbing plants. The Ficus Ginseng has a thick, pot-bellied trunk, similar to the Ginseng root.",

      "Water": "Water the Chinese banyan as soon as the soil becomes dry on one centimeter, water so as to moisten all of it. During a growth period (spring, summer), watering should be regular - once or twice a week - but measured in order not to asphyxiate the roots of plants. In a fall, space the waterings gently, until winter.",
      "Pruning": "Use sharp pruning shears to remove the sucker branches and the errant branches that are growing in the wrong direction or making it difficult to fertilize the tree. Since Chinese banyan has a conical habit, trim the tree as per its natural shape. Trimming should be done every week during the summer.",
      "Fertilizer": "Mix the recommended amount of liquid fertilizer and water in a watering can. Then simply pour the mix into the soil as if you're watering the plant.",
      "Sunlight": "Requires either part sun or part shade, does well in filtered light for most of the day.",
      "Soil": "Loam soil offers a great balance of silt, sand, and clay as well as a bit of hummus.",
      "Propagation": "Chinese banyan can be propagated by cuttings, which can be taken from the tips and rooted. Alternatively, you can do eye cuttings.",
      "Temperature": "Temperatures hovering around 60 to 70 or 75°F (15 to 25°C) are perfect if kept all year round.",
      "Container": "Choose a pot with drainage holes, which also ensures potting soil doesn't stay too wet after watering your houseplants. The excess can freely escape out the bottom of the container, allowing oxygen to make its way to plant roots.",
